# A set of Hypergraph Exchange Format (HIF) specs & validators

Hypergraph Exchange Format (HIF) is a forthcoming standardard for data exchange of the existing hypergaph libraries. 

Initial guess about the planned data format:
```
 "network-type": "hypergraph",
"metadata": {"name": "test"},
"incidences":[[2, 1, {"weight": "test", etc.}]],
"nodes":[[1, {"name": "test"}]],
"edges":[[2, {"timestamp": "2024-06-16"}]],
```
- All fields are optional except for "incidences". If there are no attributes associated with each incidence, it is an empty dictionary.
- The first two fields of each incidence record are edge, node IDs.
- If a hypergraph is, for instance, directed, the edge direction will be contained in the attribute dictionary.
- Isolated nodes and empty edges by entries in "nodes" and "edges" which are not present in the incidences.
